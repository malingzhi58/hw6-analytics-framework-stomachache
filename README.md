## Extend the project

### Data Plugin

To add new feature to the project, a new data plugin should be implemented DataPluginInterface, which contains getData, parseData and prepareData methods.

- getData method: receives optional parameters and is used to query the external apis asynchronously.

- parseData method: receives the query data and conducts data cleaning and formatting.

- prepareData method: combines above two method, and returns a Promise object.

And after finishing implementing the DataPluginInterface and constructing the data plugin, do not forget to register it in the routes as an internal api.

For example, below is how do we register the getPokemonListPlugin:

```typescript
router.get("/api/getpokemonlist", (req, res, next) => {
  const pokemonList = new getPokemonListPlugin();
  pokemonList.prepareData().then((r) => {
    // call the prepareData method to query and parse data
    res.json(r); // send the parsed data to the result
  });
});
```

### Visualization Plugin

Since we use React.js framework as frontend, we followed the functional component principle, where all the components are encapsulated in functions, not in classes. To add a new visualization plugin, you will need implement a functional component. And then add the new component in the App.tsx.
